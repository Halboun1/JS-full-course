/* ========== NUMBERS ========== */
let x = 2.5;                    // numbers with decimals
let y = 3;                      // number without decimal

let newX = 123e5;               // e5 represents how many 0's (12300000)
let newY = 123e-5;              // e-5 represents the decimals number (0.00123)


/* ========== STRINGS ========== */
let name = "John Doe";          // name variable represents sequence of characters
let carName = "Volvo XC60"      // double quotes are important to wrap around the variable value.
let carName1 = 'Volvo XC60'     // can also wrap it in single quotes.


/* ========== CONST ========== */
const hens = 4;                 // const works just like let, except you cannot change the value.
                                // use const in code when you will not change the value through out the code.
                                // example week days = 7, months = 12 or pi = 3.14159
